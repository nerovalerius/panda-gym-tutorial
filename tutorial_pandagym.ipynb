    "### Panda-Gym Introduction\n",
    "Panda-Gym is a reinforcement learning environment for the Franka Emika Panda robot. It is based on the OpenAI Gym framework and provides a set of tasks that can be used to train reinforcement learning agents. The tasks are based on the PyBullet physics engine and can be used to train agents for real-world applications. The environment is designed to be easy to use and extend. It is also possible to create custom robots, environments and tasks.\n",
    "A detailed documentation can be found [here](https://panda-gym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and their paper can be cited as folows:\n",

    "It can be programmed directly with a graphical user interface or with the Robot Operating System 1 & 2 (C++, MoveIt!, Rviz and so on).\n",
    "The torque sensors on it's 7 seven axes make this robot arm so sensitive, that it even stops at a balloon.\n",
    "It works at a very high precision as well as stability, which makes it a perfect tool for research and development.\n",

The robot was able to avoid obstacles while reaching a target.
